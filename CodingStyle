Coding style
============
* Indentation: TAB (8 spaces width)
* Braces: K&R, 1TBS
* Max line width: 80 chars
* Pointer asterisk attached to the name of the variable
* Own structures/types: _t suffix (f.e. nameserver_t)
* Header guard format: _KNOTD_HEADER_H_
* Spaces around binary operators
* Space between keyword and bracket (f.e. "if (predicate)")
* No space between variable and typecast (f.e. "return (int)val;")

To sum it up, Linux KNF is used, see [1].

AStyle command format
=====================
astyle --style=1tbs -t8 -w -p -H -U -j --align-pointer=name

Doxygen
=======
* Format: Qt-style
  * "\brief", not "@brief"
  * "/*!", not "/**"
* Order of sections
  * brief description
  * long description
  * notes
  * warnings
  * parameters
  * return values
  * todos
* Always use \brief (no autobrief)
* Indent text (using spaces only) in multiple-line sections
* In multi-line comments, opening line (/*!) should be empty
* One empty line between two consecutive sections
* Struct and union members documented on the same line if the comment fits
* Use \retval (or more of them) instead of \return
  if the function returns some distinct values
  (such as 0 for no error, -1 for something else, etc.)

Example
=======
/*! 
 * \brief Some structure.
 * 
 * Longer description.
 */
 struct some_struct {
    /*!
     * \brief This comment does not fit on the same line as the member
     *        as it is rather large. 
     */
    int fd;
    int flags; /*!< Flags. */
 };

/*!
 * \brief Brief description of some function.
 *
 * Longer description.
 * 
 * \note This function is deprecated.
 *
 * \warning Do not use this function!
 *
 * \param param1 Some parameter.
 * \param param2 Other parameter. This one has rather large comment,
 *               so its next line is indented for better readability.
 * 
 * \retval 0 on success.
 * \retval -1 if some error occured.
 *
 * \todo Remove (deprecated).
