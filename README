Knot DNS has several dependencies:
* libtool
* autoconf > 2.65
* flex >= 2.5.31
* bison >= 2.3
* libssl >= 1.0.0    (>= 1.0.1 is required for ECDSA)
* liburcu >= 0.5.4

Optional packages:
* libcap-ng >= 0.6.4 (for POSIX 1003.1e capabilites(7))
* libidn             (for IDNA2003 support in Knot utilities)
* lmdb               (for persistent events for slave zones)
* libsystemd         (for systemd init system support)

Dependencies for building documentation:
* python-sphinx

Installation
============

Knot DNS may already be included in your operating system distribution and
therefore can be installed from packages (Linux), ports (BSD) or via
Homebrew (Mac). This is always preferred unless you want to test the latest
features, contribute to Knot development, or you just know what you are doing.

Following sections describe how to build Knot DNS from the source code.

1) Install prerequisites

Debian based distributions
--------------------------
Update the system:
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get upgrade

Install prerequisites:
$ sudo apt-get install git-core libtool autoconf flex bison libssl-dev liburcu-dev

Install optional packages:
($ sudo apt-get install libcap-ng-dev liblmdb-dev libsystemd-dev)

If the liburcu-dev package is not present, install it from the source code
(http://lttng.org/urcu)

Fedora like distributions
-------------------------
Update the system:
$ yum upgrade

Ensure all base development tools are available:
$ yum install @buildsys-build

Ensure all prerequisites are installed:
$ yum install libtool autoconf flex bison openssl-devel userspace-rcu-devel

Install optional packages:
($ yum install libcap-ng-devel lmdb-devel systemd-devel)

2) Install Knot DNS

Knot DNS requires compiler to support atomic intrinsics.
GCC version at least 4.1 supports legacy atomic builtins, however 4.7
or newer is preferred.
Clang supports atomics since version 2.9.

Get the source code:
$ git clone git://git.nic.cz/knot-dns.git
Or extract source package to knot-dns directory

Compile Knot
$ cd knot-dns
$ autoreconf -if
$ ./configure
$ make

Install Knot DNS into system:
$ sudo make install
$ sudo ldconfig

NOTE: If you want to reduce zscanner compile time, use configure option --disable-fastparser.

Running
=======

1) Each server needs configuration file. Please see samples/knot.sample.conf
for reference or samples/knot.full.conf for more examples.
Configuration file has to specify:
- storage for PID files, journal files etc.
- network interfaces
- served zones

E.g. use the default config file:
$ cd /etc/knot
$ mv knot.sample.conf knot.conf
Modify the config:
$ vim knot.conf

2) Prepare working directory
$ mv example.com.zone /var/lib/knot/

3) Start the server. This can be done by running the 'knotd' command.
Alternatively, your distribution should have an init script available, if you've
installed Knot using a binary package.

Start Knot in the foreground to see if it runs:
$ knotd -c myserver.conf

For more information, refer to the user manual or:
$ knotc -h
$ knotd -h
