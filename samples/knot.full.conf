# knot.sample.conf
#
# This is a sample configuration file for Knot DNS server.
#

# This is a comment.

#
# There are 4 main sections of this config file:
#   system, zones, interfaces and log
#

# Section 'system' contains general options for the server
system {

  # Identity of the server (see RFC 4892). Not used yet.
  identity "I have no mouth and must scream";

  # Version of the server (see RFC 4892). Not used yet.
  version "0.1";

  # Working directory of the server
  # Used to store compiled zones and PID file
  storage "/tmp/knot-sample";

  # Number of workers per interface
  # This option is used to force number of threads used per interface
  # Default: unset (auto-estimates optimal value from the number of online CPUs)
  workers 1;
}

# Section 'keys' contains list of TSIG keys
keys {

  # TSIG key
  #
  # format: name key-type "<key>";
  # where key-type may be one of the following:
  #   hmac-md5
  #   hmac-sha1
  #   hmac-sha224
  #   hmac-sha256
  #   hmac-sha384
  #   hmac-sha512
  # and <key> is the private key
  key0.server0 hmac-md5 "Wg==";

  # TSIG key for zone
  key0.example.com hmac-md5 "==gW";
}

# Section 'interfaces' contains definitions of listening interfaces.
interfaces {

  # Interface entry
  # 
  # Format 1: <name> { address <address>; [port <port>;] }
  ipv4 {                # <name> is an arbitrary symbolic name
    address 127.0.0.1;  # <address> may be ither IPv4 or IPv6 address
    port 53531;         # port is required for XFR/IN and NOTIFY/OUT 
  }

  # Format 2: <name> { address <address>@<port>; }
  # shortipv4 {
  #   address 127.0.0.1@53532;
  #}

  # Format 1 (IPv6 interface)
  # ipv6 {
  #   address ::1@53533;
  # }

  # Format 2 (IPv6 interface)
  # ipv6b {
  #   address [::1]@53534;
  # }

}

# Section 'remotes' contains symbolic names for remote servers.
# Syntax for 'remotes' is the same as for 'interfaces'.
remotes {

  # Remote entry
  #
  # Format 1: <name> { address <address>; [port <port>;] }
  server0 {             # <name> is an arbitrary symbolic name

    port 53531;         # port is optional (default: 53)
    key key0.server0;    # (optional) specification of TSIG key associated for this remote
  }

  # Format 2: <name> { address <address>@<port>; }
  server1 {
    address 127.0.0.1@53001;
  }
}

# Section 'zones' contains information about zones to be served.
zones {

  # Shared options for all listed zones
  #

  # Enable semantic checks for all zones (if 'on')
  # Possible values: on|off
  # Default value: off
  semantic-checks off;

  # NOTIFY response timeout
  # Possible values: <1,...> (seconds)
  # Default value: 60
  notify-timeout 60;

  # Number of retries for NOTIFY
  # Possible values: <1,...>
  # Default value: 5
  notify-retries 5;

  # Timeout for syncing changes from zone database to zonefile
  # Possible values: <1..INT_MAX> (seconds)
  # Default value: 1h (1 hour)
  # It is also possible to suffix with unit size [s/m/h/d]
  # f.e. 1s = 1 day, 1m = 1 minute, 1h = 1 hour, 1d = 1 day
  zonefile-sync 1h;

  # File size limit for IXFR journal
  # Possible values: <1..INT_MAX>
  # Default value: N/A (infinite)
  # It is also possible to suffix with unit size [k/M/G]
  # f.e. 1k, 100M, 2G
  ixfr-fslimit 1G;

  # Zone entry
  #
  # Format: <zone-name> { file "<path-to-zone-file>"; }
  example.com {  # <zone-name> is the DNS name of the zone (zone root)
    # <path-to-zone-file> may be either absolute or relative, in which case
    #   it is considered relative to the current directory from which the server
    #   was started.
    file "samples/example.com.zone";

    # Enable zone semantic checks
    # Possible values: on|off
    # Default value: off
    semantic-checks on;

    notify-timeout 60;

    # Number of retries for NOTIFY (specific for current zone)
    # Possible values: <1,...>

    notify-retries 5;

    # Timeout for syncing changes from zone database to zonefile
    # Possible values: <1..INT_MAX> (seconds)
    # Default value: inherited from zones.zonefile-sync

    notify-in server0;

    # List of servers to send NOTIFY to 
    notify-out server0, server1;
  }
}

# Section 'log' configures logging of server messages.
#
# Logging recognizes 3 symbolic names of log devices: 
#   stdout    - Standard output
#   stderr    - Standard error output
#   syslog    - Syslog
# 
# In addition, arbitrary number of log files may be specified (see below).
#
# Log messages are characterized by severity and category.
# Supported severities: 
#   debug     - Debug messages. Must be turned on at compile time.
#   info      - Informational messages.
#   notice    - Notices and hints.
#   warning   - Warnings. An action from the operator may be required.
#   error     - Recoverable error. Some action should be taken.
#   fatal     - Non-recoverable errors resulting in server shutdown.
#               (Not supported yet.)
#   all       - All severities.
#
# Categories designate the source of the log message and roughly correspond
#   to server modules
# Supported categories:
#   server    - Messages related to general operation of the server.
#   zone      - Messages related to zones, zone parsing and loading.
#   answering - Messages regarding query processing and response creation.
#   any       - All categories
#
# More severities (separated by commas) may be listed for each category.
# All applicable severities must be listed. 
#   (I.e. specifying 'error' severity does mean: 'log error messages', 
#    and NOT 'log all messages of severity error and above'.)
#
# Default settings (in case there are no entries in 'log' section or the section
# is missing at all):
#
# stderr { any error; }
# syslog { any error; }
log {

  # Log entry
  #
  # Format 1: 
  # <log> { 
  #   <category1> <severity1> [, <severity2> ...]; 
  #   <category2> <severity1> [, <severity2> ...];
  #   ...
  # } 
  syslog {     # <log> is a symbolic name of a log device (see above)
    # log errors of any category 
    any error;    # for <category> and <severity> see above
    # log also warnings and notices from category 'zone'
    zone warning, notice;
    # log info from server
    server info;
  }

  # Log fatal, warnings and errors to stderr
  stderr {
    any error, warning;
  }

  # Format 2:
  # file <path> {
  #   <category1> <severity1> [, <severity2> ...];
  #   <category2> <severity1> [, <severity2> ...];
  # }
  file "/tmp/knot-sample/knotd.debug" {  # <path> is absolute or relative path to log file
    server debug;
  }
}
