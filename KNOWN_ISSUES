Features not supported
======================

Here is a list of the most notable features that are not supported in the 
current version of Knot.

* IXFR
* Dynamic updates
* TSIG
* Slave functionality (AXFR-in).
* RRSet rotation
* Root zone (Knot cannot serve the root zone)
* Other DNS classes than IN (CH, CS, HS)

Known bugs
==========

* Certain malformed packets cause the server to crash.
* Some actions may not be fully thread-safe (e.g. removing expired zone).
* If some hashed domain name (NSEC3) contains other data than NSEC3 and RRSIG,
  queries for this data will not be responded well (always answers NXDOMAIN).
* Server fails to quit properly on some systems.
