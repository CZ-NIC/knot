===========================

Bugfixes:
---------
 - Fixed bug with creating journal files.

Knot DNS 1.0.4 (2012-05-16)
===========================

Features:
---------
 - Parallel loading of zones to the server.
 - RFC3339-complaint format of log time.
 - Support for TLSA (RR type 52).

-------------
 - Significantly sped up IXFR-in and reduced its memory requirements.

Bugfixes:
---------
 - Copying OPCODE and RD bit from query to NOTIMPL responses.
 - Corrected response to CNAME queries if the canonical name was also
    an alias (was adding the whole CNAME chain to the response).
 - Fixed crash when NS or MX points to an alias.
 - Fixed problem with early closing of filedescriptors (lead to crash
    when compiling and loading or bootstrapping and restarting the
    server with a lot of zones).

Knot DNS 1.0.3 (2012-04-17)
===========================

Bugfixes:
---------
 - Corrected handling of EDNS0 when TCP is used (was applying the UDP
   size limit).

 - Fixed potential crash with many concurrent transfers.
 - Fixed missing include for FreeBSD.

Knot DNS 1.0.2 (2012-04-13)
===========================

Features:

   directly.

Bugfixes:
---------
 - Fixed leak when querying non-existing name and zone SOA TTL >
   minimal.
 - Fixed some minor bugs in tansfers.

Improvements:
-------------
 - Improved log messages (added date and time, better specification of
   XFR remote).
 - Improved saving incoming IXFR to journal (memory optimized).
 - Now using system scheduler (better for Linux).
 - Decreased thread stack size.

Bugfixes:
---------
 - Problem with creating IXFR journal for bootstrapped zone.

===========================

Features:
---------
 - Support for subnets in ACL.

 - Optimized memory consuption of zone structures.
 - NSID support (RFC5001).
 - Root zone support.
 - Automatic zone compiling on server start.
 - Setting user to run Knot under in config file.
 - Dropping privileges after binding to port 53.
    + Support for Linux capabilities(7).
 - Setting source address of outgoing transfers in config file.
 - Custom PID file.
 - CNAME loop detection.
 - Timeout on TCP connections.
 - Basic defense against DoS attacks.

Bugfixes:
---------
 - Memory errors and leaks.
 - Fixed improper handling of failed IXFR/IN.
 - Several other minor bugfixes.
 - Fixed IXFR processing.
 - Patched URCU so that it compiles on architectures without TLS in
   compiler (NetBSD, OpenBSD).
 - Fixed response to DS query at parent zone.
 - A lot of other bugfixes.

Knot DNS 0.9.1 (2012-01-20)
===========================

Features:
---------
 - RRSet rotation

Improvements:
-------------
 - Replaced pseudo-random number generator by one with MIT/BSD
   license.

Bugfixes:
---------
 - Fixed build on BSD.
 - Fixes in parsing and dumping of zone RR types IPSECKEY, WKS, DLV,
    APL, NSAP

Knot DNS 0.9.0 (2012-01-13)
===========================

Features:
---------
 - TSIG support in both client and server.
 - Use of sendmmsg() on Linux 3.0+ (improves performance).

Bugfixes:
---------
 - Knot was not accepting AXFR-style IXFR with first SOA in a separate
    packet (i.e. from Power DNS).
 - Wrong SOA TTL in negative answers.
 - Wrong max packet size for outgoing transfers (was causing the
    packets to be malformed).
 - Wrong handling of WKS record in zone compiler.
 - Problems with zone bootstrapping.
