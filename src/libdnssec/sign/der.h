 * The ECDSA signatures in DNSSEC are encoded differently than in X.509

 * of the signature.
 *
 * This module provides decoding and encoding of this format.
 *
 * The 'r' and 's' values are treated as unsigned values: The leading zeroes
 * are stripped on decoding; an extra leading zero is added on encoding in case
 * the value starts with a set bit.
