 * #                     - Hashtag matches for a number in timespec, stands for either a UNIX timestamp,
 *                         or, within a context of an unit, as a number of such units.
 * Y, M, D, h, m, s      - Matches a number, stands for a number of years, months, days, hours,
 *                         minutes and seconds, respectively.
 * +, -                  - The + and - signs declaring that following timespec is relative to "now".
 *                         A single sign can be used to limit the timestamp being in future or in past,
 *                         or both +- allow the timestamp to select any (just one) of them.
 * U                     - Matches one of Y, M, D, h, m, s in the timespec standing for a time unit.
 * u                     - Like U, but the unit in the timestamp is from: y, mo, d, h, mi, s.
