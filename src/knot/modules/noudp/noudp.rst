.. _mod-noudp:

``noudp`` â€” No UDP response
===========================

The module sends empty truncated response to a UDP query. TCP queries are
not affected.

Example
-------

To enable this module for all configured zones and every UDP query::

    template:
      - id: default
        global-module: mod-noudp

Or with specified UDP allow rate::

    mod-noudp:
      - id: sometimes
        udp-allow-rate: 1000  # Don't truncate every 1000th UDP query

    template:
      - id: default
        module: mod-noudp/sometimes

Module reference
