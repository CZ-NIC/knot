.. _mod-queryacl:

``queryacl`` â€” Limit queries by remote address or target interface
==================================================================

This module provides a simple way to whitelist incoming queries
according to the query's source address or target interface.
It can be used e.g. to create a restricted-access subzone with delegations from the corresponding public zone.
The module may be enabled both globally and per-zone.

.. NOTE::
    The module limits only regular queries. Notify, transfer and update are handled by :ref:`ACL<ACL>`.

Example
-------

::

   mod-queryacl:

       interface: 198.51.100
