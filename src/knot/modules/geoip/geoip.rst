.. _mod-geoip:

``geoip`` — Geography-based responses
=====================================

This module offers response tailoring based on client's
subnet or geographic location. It supports GeoIP databases
in the MaxMind DB format, such as `GeoIP2 <https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/downloadable/>`_
or the free version `GeoLite2 <https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/geolite2/>`_.

The module can be enabled only per zone.

.. NOTE::
   If :ref:`EDNS Client Subnet<server_edns-client-subnet>` support is enabled
   and if a query contains this option, the module takes advantage of this
   information to provide a more accurate response.

DNSSEC support
--------------

There are two ways to enable DNSSEC signing of tailored responses.
If automatic DNSSEC signing is enabled, record signatures are precomputed when the module is loaded. 
This has a speed benefit, however note that every RRset configured in the module should
have a **default** RRset of the same type contained in the zone, so that the NSEC(3)
chain can be built correctly. Also, it is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to use manual key rollover in this setting,
as the module has to be reloaded when the signing key changes.

.. NOTE::
   If the GeoIP module is used with automatic DNSSEC signing, the keys for computing record signatures
   MUST exist or be generated before the server is launched, otherwise the module fails to
   compute the signatures and does not load.

Alternatively, the :ref:`geoip<mod-geoip>` module may be combined with the
:ref:`onlinesign<mod-onlinesign>` module and the tailored responses can be signed
on the fly. This approach is much more computationally demanding for the server.

.. NOTE::
   If the GeoIP module is used with online signing, it is recommended to set the :ref:`nsec-bitmap<mod-onlinesign_nsec-bitmap>`
   option of the onlinesign module to contain all Resource Record types potentially generated by the module.

Example
-------
* An example configuration.::

   mod-geoip:
     - id: default
       config-file: /path/to/geo.conf
       ttl: 20
       mode: geodb
       geodb-file: /path/to/GeoLite2-City.mmdb
       geodb-key: [ country/iso_code, city/names/en ]

   zone:
     - domain: example.com.
       module: mod-geoip/default


Configuration file
------------------

Every instance of the module requires an additional :ref:`mod-geoip_config-file`
in which the desired responses to queries from various locations are configured.
This file has the following simple format:

::

   domain-name1:
     - geo|net: location1
       RR-Type1: RDATA
       RR-Type2: RDATA
       ...
     - geo|net: location2
       RR-Type1: RDATA
     ...
   domain-name2:
   ...


Example
-------

* Example :ref:`mod-geoip_config-file` for subnets

::

   foo.example.com:
     - net: 10.0.0.0/24
       A: [ 192.168.1.1, 192.168.1.2 ]
       AAAA: [ 2001:DB8::1, 2001:DB8::2 ]
       TXT: "subnet 10.0.0.0/24"
     ...
   bar.example.com:
     - net: 2001:DB8::/32
       A: 192.168.1.3
       AAAA: 2001:DB8::3
       TXT: "subnet 2001:DB8::/32"
   ...

* Example :ref:`mod-geoip_config-file` for geographic locations

::

   foo.example.com:
     - geo: "CZ;Prague"
       CNAME: cz.foo.example.com
     - geo: "US;Las Vegas"
       CNAME: vegas.foo.example.net
     - geo: "US;*"
       CNAME: us.foo.example.net
   ...


Module reference
----------------

::

 mod-geoip:
   - id: STR
     config-file: STR
     ttl: TIME
     mode: geodb | subnet
     geodb-file: STR
     geodb-key: STR ...

.. _mod-geoip_id:

id
..

A module identifier.

.. _mod-geoip_config-file:

config-file
...........

Full path to the response configuration file as described above.

*Required*

.. _mod-geoip_ttl:

ttl
...

The time to live of Resource Records returned by the module.

*Default:* 60

.. _mod-geoip_mode:

mode
....

The mode of operation of the module.

Possible values:

- ``subnet`` – Responses are tailored according to subnets.
- ``geodb`` – Responses are tailored according to geographic data retrieved
  from the configured database.

*Default:* subnet

.. _mod-geoip_geodb-file:

geodb-file
..........

Full path to a .mmdb file containing the GeoIP database.

*Reqired if* :ref:`mod-geoip_mode` *is set to* **geodb**

.. _mod-geoip_geodb-key:

geodb-key
.........

Multi-valued item, can be specified up to **8** times. Each **geodb-key** specifies
a path to a key in a node in the supplied GeoIP database. The module currently supports
two types of values: **string** or **32-bit unsigned int**. In the latter
case, the key has to be prefixed with **(id)**. Common choices of keys include:

* **continent/code**

* **country/iso_code**

* **(id)country/geoname_id**

* **city/names/en**

* **(id)city/geoname_id**

* **isp**

* ...

In the zone's config file for the module the values of the keys are entered in the same order
as the keys in the module's configuration, separated by a semicolon. Enter the value **"*"**
if the key is allowed to have any value.
