 *
 * \brief SLAB allocator.
 *
 * SLAB cache works with either custom SLAB sizes and
 * Next-Highest-Power-Of-2 sizes.
 *
 * Slab size is a multiple of PAGE_SIZE and uses
 * system allocator for larger blocks.
 *
 * Allocated SLABs are PAGE_SIZE aligned for a fast O(1)
 * address-from-item lookup. This results in nearly none memory
 * overhead for a very small blocks (<64B), but it requires the
 * underlying allocator to be effective in allocating page size aligned memory
 * as well. The major disadvantage is that each Slab must be aligned to it's
 * size as opposed to boundary tags.
 *
 * Slab implements simple coloring mechanism to improve
 * cache line utilisation.
 *
 * \ref SLAB_SIZE is a fixed size of a slab. As a rule of thumb, the slab is
 * effective when the maximum allocated block size is below 1/4 of a SLAB_SIZE.
 * f.e. 16kB SLAB is most effective up to 4kB block size.
 *
 * \ref MEM_POISON flag enables checking read/writes after the allocated memory
 * and segmentation fault. This poses a significant time and space overhead.
 * Enable only when debugging.
 *
 * \ref MEM_SLAB_CAP defines a maximum limit of a number of empty slabs that a cache
 * can keep at a time. This results in a slight performance regression,
 * but actively recycles unuse memory.
 *
 * \ref MEM_DEPOT_COUNT defines how many recycled slabs will be cached for a later
 * use instead of returning them immediately to the OS. This significantly
 * reduces a number of syscalls in some cases.
 * f.e. 16 means 16 * SLAB_SIZE cache, for 16kB slabs = 256kB cache
 *
 * \ref MEM_COLORING enables simple cache coloring. This is generally a useful
 *      feature since all slabs are page size aligned and
 *      (depending on architecture) this slightly improves performance
 *      and cacheline usage at the cost of a minimum of 64 bytes per slab of
 *      overhead. Undefine MEM_COLORING in common.h to disable coloring.
 *
 * Optimal usage for a specific behavior (similar allocation sizes):
 * \code
 * slab_cache_t cache;
 * slab_cache_init(&cache, N); // Initialize, N means cache chunk size
 * ...
 * void* mem = slab_cache_alloc(&cache); // Allocate N bytes
 * ...
 * slab_free(mem); // Recycle memory
 * ...
 * slab_cache_destroy(&cache); // Deinitialize cache
 * \endcode
 *
 *
 * \todo Allocate slab headers elsewhere and use just first sizeof(void*) bytes
 *       in each slab as a pointer to slab header. This could improve the
 *       performance.
 *
 * \note Slab allocation is not thread safe for performance reasons.

 * \brief Slab cache descriptor.
 *
 * Slab cache is a list of 0..n slabs with the same buf size.
 * It is responsible for slab state keeping.
 *
 * Once a slab is created, it is moved to free list.
 * When it is full, it is moved to full list.
 * Once a buf from full slab is freed, the slab is moved to
 * free list again (there may be some hysteresis for mitigating
 * a sequential alloc/free).
 *
 * Allocation of new slabs is on-demand, empty slabs are reused if possible.
 *
 * \note Slab implementation is different from Bonwick (Usenix 2001)
 *       http://www.usenix.org/event/usenix01/bonwick.html
 *       as it doesn't feature empty and partial list.
 *       This is due to fact, that user space allocator rarely
 *       needs to count free slabs. There is no way the OS could
 *       notify the application, that the memory is scarce.
 *       A slight performance increased is measured in benchmark.
 *
 * \note Statistics are only available if MEM_DEBUG is enabled.
