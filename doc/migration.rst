Automatic DNSSEC signing
------------------------

Migrating automatically signed zones from BIND to Knot DNS is very
easy due to the fact that Knot DNS is able to use DNSSEC keys
generated by BIND.

1. To obtain current content of the zone which is being migrated,
   request BIND to flush the zone into the zone file: ``rndc flush
   example.com``.

   *Note:* If dynamic updates (DDNS) are enabled for the given zone, you
   might need to freeze the zone before flushing it. That can be done
   similarly: ``rndc freeze example.com``

2. Copy the fresh zone file into the zones storage directory of Knot
   DNS. Its default location is ``/var/lib/knot``.

3. We recommend to store DNSSEC keys for each zone in a separate
   directory. For this purpose, create a directory
   ``example.com.keys`` in the zones storage directory. Then copy all
   DNSSEC keys (``*.key`` and ``*.private``) from BIND key directory
   (configured as ``key-directory``) into the newly created one.

4. Add the zone into the Knot DNS configuration file. Zone
   configuration should contain at least the specification of the zone
   file (option ``file``), key directory (option ``kasp-db``),
   and permission for automatic DNSSEC signing (option ``dnssec-signing``).

   You can follow this example::

    zone:
      - domain: "example.com."
        file: "example.com.db"
        storage: "/var/lib/knot"
        dnssec-signing: on
        kasp-db: "example.com.keys"

5. Start Knot DNS and check the log files to make sure that everything went right.
