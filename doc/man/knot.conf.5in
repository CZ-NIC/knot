.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Configuration files for Knot DNS use simplified YAML format. Simplified means
that not all of the features are supported.
.sp
For the description of configuration items, we have to declare a meaning of
the following symbols:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fIINT\fP – Integer
.IP \(bu 2
\fISTR\fP – Textual string
.IP \(bu 2
\fIHEXSTR\fP – Hexadecimal string (with \fB0x\fP prefix)
.IP \(bu 2
\fIBOOL\fP – Boolean value (\fBon\fP/\fBoff\fP or \fBtrue\fP/\fBfalse\fP)
.IP \(bu 2
\fITIME\fP – Number of seconds, an integer with possible time multiplier suffix
(\fBs\fP ~ 1, \fBm\fP ~ 60, \fBh\fP ~ 3600 or \fBd\fP ~ 24 * 3600)
.IP \(bu 2
\fISIZE\fP – Number of bytes, an integer with possible size multiplier suffix
(\fBB\fP ~ 1, \fBK\fP ~ 1024, \fBM\fP ~ 1024^2 or \fBG\fP ~ 1024^3)
.IP \(bu 2
\fIBASE64\fP – Base64 encoded string
.IP \(bu 2
\fIADDR\fP – IPv4 or IPv6 address
.IP \(bu 2
\fIDNAME\fP – Domain name
.IP \(bu 2
\&... – Multi\-valued item, order of the values is preserved
.IP \(bu 2
[ ] – Optional value
.IP \(bu 2
| – Choice
.UNINDENT
.sp
The configuration consists of several fixed sections and optional module
sections. There are 14 fixed sections (\fBmodule\fP, \fBserver\fP, \fBcontrol\fP,
\fBlog\fP, \fBstatistics\fP, \fBdatabase\fP, \fBkeystore\fP, \fBkey\fP, \fBremote\fP,
\fBacl\fP, \fBsubmission\fP, \fBpolicy\fP, \fBtemplate\fP, \fBzone\fP).
Module sections are prefixed with the \fBmod\-\fP prefix (e.g. \fBmod\-stats\fP).
.sp
Most of the sections (e.g. \fBzone\fP) are sequences of settings blocks. Each
settings block begins with a unique identifier, which can be used as a reference
from other sections (such an identifier must be defined in advance).
.sp
A multi\-valued item can be specified either as a YAML sequence:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
address: [10.0.0.1, 10.0.0.2]
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
or as more single\-valued items each on an extra line:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
address: 10.0.0.1
address: 10.0.0.2
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If an item value contains spaces or other special characters, it is necessary
to enclose such a value within double quotes \fB"\fP \fB"\fP\&.
.SH COMMENTS
.sp
A comment begins with a \fB#\fP character and is ignored during processing.
Also each configuration section or sequence block allows a permanent
comment using the \fBcomment\fP item which is stored in the server beside the
configuration.
.SH INCLUDES
.sp
Another configuration file or files, matching a pattern, can be included at
the top level in the current file. If the path is not absolute, then it
is considered to be relative to the current file. The pattern can be
an arbitrary string meeting POSIX \fIglob\fP requirements, e.g. dir/*.conf.
Matching files are processed in sorted order.

\fBCAUTION:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
When you change configuration parameters dynamically or via configuration file
reload, some parameters in the Server section require restarting the Knot server
so that the changes take effect. See below for the details.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS identity
.sp
An identity of the server returned in the response to the query for TXT
record \fBid.server.\fP or \fBhostname.bind.\fP in the CHAOS class (\fI\%RFC 4892\fP).
Set to an empty value to disable.
.sp
\fIDefault:\fP FQDN hostname
.SS version
.sp
A version of the server software returned in the response to the query
for TXT record \fBversion.server.\fP or \fBversion.bind.\fP in the CHAOS
class (\fI\%RFC 4892\fP). Set to an empty value to disable.
.sp
\fIDefault:\fP server version
.SS nsid
.sp
A DNS name server identifier (\fI\%RFC 5001\fP). Set to an empty value to disable.
.sp
\fIDefault:\fP FQDN hostname
.SS rundir
.sp
A path for storing run\-time data (PID file, unix sockets, etc.).
.sp
Depending on the usage of this parameter, its change may require restart of the Knot
server to take effect.
.sp
\fIDefault:\fP \fB${localstatedir}/run/knot\fP (configured with \fB\-\-with\-rundir=path\fP)
.SS user
.sp
A system user with an optional system group (\fBuser:group\fP) under which the
server is run after starting and binding to interfaces. Linux capabilities
are employed if supported.
.sp
Change of this parameter requires restart of the Knot server to take effect.
.sp
\fIDefault:\fP root:root
.SS pidfile
.sp
A PID file location.
.sp
Change of this parameter requires restart of the Knot server to take effect.
.sp
\fIDefault:\fP \fI\%rundir\fP/knot.pid
.SS udp\-workers
.sp
A number of UDP workers (threads) used to process incoming queries
over UDP.
.sp
Change of this parameter requires restart of the Knot server to take effect.
.sp
\fIDefault:\fP equal to the number of online CPUs
.SS tcp\-workers
.sp
A number of TCP workers (threads) used to process incoming queries
over TCP.
.sp
Change of this parameter requires restart of the Knot server to take effect.
.sp
\fIDefault:\fP equal to the number of online CPUs, default value is at least 10
.SS background\-workers
.sp
A number of workers (threads) used to execute background operations (zone
loading, zone updates, etc.).
.sp
Change of this parameter requires restart of the Knot server to take effect.
.sp
\fIDefault:\fP equal to the number of online CPUs, default value is at most 10
.SS async\-start
.sp
If enabled, server doesn\(aqt wait for the zones to be loaded and starts
responding immediately with SERVFAIL answers until the zone loads.
.sp
\fIDefault:\fP off
.SS tcp\-idle\-timeout
.sp
Maximum idle time (in seconds) between requests on an inbound TCP connection.
It means if there is no activity on an inbound TCP connection during this limit,
the connection is closed by the server.
.sp
\fIMinimum:\fP 1 s
.sp
\fIDefault:\fP 10 s
.SS tcp\-io\-timeout
.sp
Maximum time (in milliseconds) to receive or send one DNS message over an inbound
TCP connection. It means this limit applies to normal DNS queries and replies,
incoming DDNS, and outgoing zone transfers. The timeout is measured since some
data is already available for processing.
Set to 0 for infinity.
.sp
\fIDefault:\fP 500 ms
.sp
\fBCAUTION:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
In order to reduce the risk of Slow Loris attacks, it\(aqs recommended setting
this limit as low as possible on public servers.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS tcp\-remote\-io\-timeout
.sp
Maximum time (in milliseconds) to receive or send one DNS message over an outbound
TCP connection which has already been established to a configured remote server.
It means this limit applies to incoming zone transfers, sending NOTIFY,
DDNS forwarding, and DS check or push. This timeout includes the time needed
for a network round\-trip and for a query processing by the remote.
Set to 0 for infinity.
.sp
\fIDefault:\fP 5000 ms
.SS tcp\-reuseport
.sp
If enabled, each TCP worker listens on its own socket and the OS kernel
socket load balancing is emloyed using SO_REUSEPORT (or SO_REUSEPORT_LB
on FreeBSD). Due to the lack of one shared socket, the server can offer
higher response rate processing over TCP. However, in the case of
time\-consuming requests (e.g. zone transfers of a TLD zone), enabled reuseport
may result in delayed or not being responded client requests. So it is
advisable to use this option on secondary (slave) servers.
.sp
Change of this parameter requires restart of the Knot server to take effect.
.sp
\fIDefault:\fP off
.SS tcp\-max\-clients
.sp
A maximum number of TCP clients connected in parallel, set this below the file
descriptor limit to avoid resource exhaustion.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
It is advisable to adjust the maximum number of open files per process in your
operating system configuration.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fIDefault:\fP one half of the file descriptor limit for the server process
.SS udp\-max\-payload
.sp
Maximum EDNS0 UDP payload size default for both IPv4 and IPv6.
.sp
\fIDefault:\fP 1232
.SS udp\-max\-payload\-ipv4
.sp
Maximum EDNS0 UDP payload size for IPv4.
.sp
\fIDefault:\fP 1232
.SS udp\-max\-payload\-ipv6
.sp
Maximum EDNS0 UDP payload size for IPv6.
.sp
\fIDefault:\fP 1232
.SS edns\-client\-subnet
.sp
Enable or disable EDNS Client Subnet support. If enabled, responses to queries
containing the EDNS Client Subnet option
always contain a valid EDNS Client Subnet option according to \fI\%RFC 7871\fP\&.
.sp
\fIDefault:\fP off
.SS answer\-rotation
.sp
Enable or disable sorted\-rrset rotation in the answer section of normal replies.
The rotation shift is simply determined by a query ID.
.sp
\fIDefault:\fP off
.SS listen
.sp
One or more IP addresses where the server listens for incoming queries.
Optional port specification (default is 53) can be appended to each address
using \fB@\fP separator. Use \fB0.0.0.0\fP for all configured IPv4 addresses or
\fB::\fP for all configured IPv6 addresses. Non\-local address binding is
automatically enabled if supported by the operating system.
.sp
Change of this parameter requires restart of the Knot server to take effect.
.sp
\fIDefault:\fP not set
.SS listen\-xdp
.sp
One or more network device names (e.g. \fBens786f0\fP) on which the Mode XDP
is enabled. Alternatively, an IP address can be used instead of a device name,
but the server will still listen on all addresses belonging to the same interface!
Optional port specification (default is 53) can be appended to each device name
or address using \fB@\fP separator.
.sp
Change of this parameter requires restart of the Knot server to take effect.
.sp
\fIDefault:\fP not set
.sp
\fBCAUTION:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Since XDP workers only process regular DNS traffic over UDP, it is strongly
recommended to also \fI\%listen\fP on the addresses which are
intended to offer the DNS service, at least to fulfil the DNS requirement for
working TCP.

.SH LOGGING SECTION
.sp
Server can be configured to log to the standard output, standard error
output, syslog (or systemd journal if systemd is enabled) or into an arbitrary
file.
.sp
There are 6 logging severity levels:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBcritical\fP – Non\-recoverable error resulting in server shutdown.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBerror\fP – Recoverable error, action should be taken.

\fBwarning\fP – Warning that might require user action.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBnotice\fP – Server notice or hint.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBinfo\fP – Informational message.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBdebug\fP – Debug or detailed message.
.UNINDENT
.sp
In the case of a missing log section, \fBwarning\fP or more serious messages
will be logged to both standard error output and syslog. The \fBinfo\fP and
\fBnotice\fP messages will be logged to standard output.

.UNINDENT
.sp
With \fBsyslog\fP target, syslog service is used. However, if Knot DNS has been compiled
with systemd support and operating system has been booted with systemd, systemd journal
is used for logging instead of syslog.
.SS server
.sp

better performance at the expense of lower database durability in the case of
a crash. This mode is recommended on secondary (slave) nodes with many zones.
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fIDefault:\fP robust
.SS journal\-db\-max\-size
.sp
The hard limit for the journal database maximum size. There is no cleanup logic
in journal to recover from reaching this limit. Journal simply starts refusing
changes across all zones. Decreasing this value has no effect if it is lower
than the actual database file size.

in wire format without compression. The limit is enforced for incoming zone
transfers and dynamic updates.
.sp
For incremental transfers (IXFR), the effective limit for the total size of
the records in the transfer is twice the configured value. However the final
size of the zone must satisfy the configured value.
.sp
\fIDefault:\fP 2^64
.SS adjust\-threads
.sp
Parallelize internal zone adjusting procedures. This is useful with huge
zones with NSEC3. Speedup observable at server startup and while processing
NSEC3 re\-salt.
.sp
\fIDefault:\fP 1
.SS dnssec\-signing
.sp
If enabled, automatic DNSSEC signing for the zone is turned on.
.sp
\fIDefault:\fP off
.SS dnssec\-validation
.sp
If enabled, the zone contents are validated for being correctly signed
(including NSEC/NSEC3 chain) with DNSSEC signatures every time the zone
is loaded or changed (including AXFR/IXFR).
.sp
When the validation fails, the zone being loaded or update being applied
is cancelled with an error, and either none or previous zone state is published.
.sp
List of DNSSEC checks:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Every zone RRSet is correctly signed by at least one present DNSKEY.
.IP \(bu 2
DNSKEY RRSet is signed by KSK.
.IP \(bu 2
NSEC(3) RR exists for each name (unless opt\-out) with correct bitmap.
.IP \(bu 2
Every NSEC(3) RR is linked to the lexicographically next one.
.UNINDENT
.sp
The validation is not affected by \fI\%dnssec\-policy\fP configuration,
except for \fI\%signing\-threads\fP option, which specifies the number
of threads for parallel validation.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Redundant or garbage NSEC3 records are ignored.
.sp
This mode is not compatible with \fI\%dnssec\-signing\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS dnssec\-policy
.sp
A \fI\%reference\fP to DNSSEC signing policy.
.sp
\fIDefault:\fP an imaginary policy with all default values
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
A configured policy called "default" won\(aqt be used unless explicitly referenced.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS serial\-policy
.sp
Specifies how the zone serial is updated after a dynamic update or
automatic DNSSEC signing. If the serial is changed by the dynamic update,
no change is made.
.sp
Possible values:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBincrement\fP – The serial is incremented according to serial number arithmetic.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBunixtime\fP – The serial is set to the current unix time.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBdateserial\fP – The 10\-digit serial (YYYYMMDDnn) is incremented, the first
8 digits match the current iso\-date.
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
In case of \fBunixtime\fP, if the resulting serial is lower or equal than current zone
(this happens e.g. in case of migrating from other policy or frequent updates)
the serial is incremented instead.
.sp
Use dateserial only if you expect less than 100 updates per day per zone.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fIDefault:\fP increment
.SS refresh\-min\-interval
.sp
Forced minimum zone refresh interval to avoid flooding primary (master) server.
.sp
\fIDefault:\fP 2
.SS refresh\-max\-interval
.sp
Forced maximum zone refresh interval.
.sp
\fIDefault:\fP not set
.SS catalog\-role
.sp
Trigger zone catalog feature. Possible values:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBnone\fP – Not a catalog zone.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBinterpret\fP – A catalog zone which is loaded from a zone file or XFR,
and member zones shall be configured based on its contents.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBgenerate\fP – A catalog zone whose contents are generated according to
assigned member zones.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBmember\fP – A member zone that is assigned to one generated catalog zone.
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fIDefault:\fP none
.SS catalog\-template
.sp
For the catalog\-member zones, the specified configuration template will be applied.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
This option must be set if and only if \fI\%catalog\-role\fP is \fIinterpret\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fIDefault:\fP not set
.SS catalog\-zone
.sp
Assign this member zone to specified generated catalog zone.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
This option must be set if and only if \fI\%catalog\-role\fP is \fImember\fP\&.
.sp
The referenced catalog zone must exist and have \fI\%catalog\-role\fP set to \fIgenerate\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fIDefault:\fP not set
.SS module
.sp
An ordered list of references to query modules in the form of \fImodule_name\fP or
\fImodule_name/module_id\fP\&. These modules apply only to the current zone queries.
