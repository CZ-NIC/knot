.. _Description:

Description
===========

Configuration files for Knot DNS use simplified YAML format. Simplified means
that not all of the features are supported.

For the description of configuration items, we have to declare a meaning of
the following symbols:

- *INT* – Integer
- *STR* – Textual string
- *HEXSTR* – Hexadecimal string (with ``0x`` prefix)
- *BOOL* – Boolean value (``on``/``off`` or ``true``/``false``)
- *TIME* – Number of seconds, an integer with possible time multiplier suffix
  (``s`` ~ 1, ``m`` ~ 60, ``h`` ~ 3600 or ``d`` ~ 24 * 3600)
- *SIZE* – Number of bytes, an integer with possible size multiplier suffix
  (``B`` ~ 1, ``K`` ~ 1024, ``M`` ~ 1024^2 or ``G`` ~ 1024^3)
- *BASE64* – Base64 encoded string
- *ADDR* – IPv4 or IPv6 address
- *DNAME* – Domain name
- ... – Multi-valued item, order of the values is preserved
- [ ] – Optional value
- \| – Choice

There are 10 main sections (``server``, ``control``, ``log``, ``keystore``,
``policy``, ``key``, ``acl``, ``remote``, ``template``, and ``zone``) and
module sections with the ``mod-`` prefix. Most of the sections (excluding
``server`` and ``control``) are sequences of settings blocks. Each settings block
begins with a unique identifier, which can be used as a reference from other
sections (such identifier must be defined in advance).

A multi-valued item can be specified either as a YAML sequence::

 address: [10.0.0.1, 10.0.0.2]

or as more single-valued items each on an extra line::

 address: 10.0.0.1
 address: 10.0.0.2

If an item value contains spaces or other special characters, it is necessary
to enclose such value within double quotes ``"`` ``"``.

.. _Comments:

Comments
========

A comment begins with a ``#`` character and is ignored during processing.
Also each configuration section or sequence block allows to specify permanent
comment using ``comment`` item which is stored in the server beside the
configuration.

.. _Includes:

Includes
========

Another configuration file or files, matching a pattern, can be included at
the top level in the current file. If the path is not absolute, then it
is considered to be relative to the current file. The pattern can be
an arbitrary string meeting POSIX *glob* requirements, e.g. dir/\*.conf.
Matching files are processed in sorted order.

::

 include: STR

record ``id.server.`` or ``hostname.bind.`` in the CHAOS class (see RFC 4892).
Set empty value to disable.

*Default:* FQDN hostname

-------

A version of the server software returned in the response to the query
for TXT record ``version.server.`` or ``version.bind.`` in the CHAOS
class (see RFC 4892). Set empty value to disable.

*Default:* server version

.. _server_nsid:

*Default:* FQDN hostname

.. _server_rundir:

rundir
------

A path for storing run-time data (PID file, unix sockets, etc.).

*Default:* ``${localstatedir}/run/knot`` (configured with ``--with-rundir=path``)

.. _server_user:

user
----

A system user with an optional system group (``user:group``) under which the
server is run after starting and binding to interfaces. Linux capabilities
are employed if supported.

*Default:* root:root

.. _server_pidfile:

pidfile
-------

A PID file location.

*Default:* :ref:`rundir<server_rundir>`/knot.pid

.. _server_udp-workers:

over UDP.

*Default:* auto-estimated optimal value based on the number of online CPUs

.. _server_tcp-workers:

tcp-workers
-----------

A number of TCP workers (threads) used to process incoming queries
over TCP.

*Default:* auto-estimated optimal value based on the number of online CPUs

.. _server_background-workers:

background-workers
------------------

A number of workers (threads) used to execute background operations (zone
loading, zone updates, etc.).

*Default:* auto-estimated optimal value based on the number of online CPUs

.. _server_async-start:

async-start
-----------

If enabled, server doesn't wait for the zones to be loaded and starts
responding immediately with SERVFAIL answers until the zone loads.

*Default:* off

.. _server_tcp-handshake-timeout:

tcp-handshake-timeout
---------------------

Maximum time between newly accepted TCP connection and the first query.
This is useful to disconnect inactive connections faster than connections
that already made at least 1 meaningful query.

*Default:* 5

.. _server_tcp-idle-timeout:

tcp-idle-timeout
----------------

Maximum idle time between requests on a TCP connection. This also limits
receiving of a single query, each query must be received in this time limit.

*Default:* 20

.. _server_tcp-reply-timeout:

tcp-reply-timeout
-----------------

Maximum time to wait for an outgoing connection or for a reply to an issued
request (SOA, NOTIFY, AXFR...).

*Default:* 10

.. _server_max-tcp-clients:

max-tcp-clients
---------------

A maximum number of TCP clients connected in parallel, set this below the file
descriptor limit to avoid resource exhaustion.

*Default:* 100

.. _server_rate-limit:

rate-limit
----------

Rate limiting is based on the token bucket scheme. A rate basically
represents a number of tokens available each second. Each response is
processed and classified (based on several discriminators, e.g.
source netblock, query type, zone name, rcode, etc.). Classified responses are
then hashed and assigned to a bucket containing number of available
tokens, timestamp and metadata. When available tokens are exhausted,
response is dropped or sent as truncated (see :ref:`server_rate-limit-slip`).
Number of available tokens is recalculated each second.

*Default:* 0 (disabled)

.. _server_rate-limit-table-size:

rate-limit-table-size
---------------------

Size of the hash table in a number of buckets. The larger the hash table, the lesser
the probability of a hash collision, but at the expense of additional memory costs.
Each bucket is estimated roughly to 32 bytes. The size should be selected as
a reasonably large prime due to better hash function distribution properties.
Hash table is internally chained and works well up to a fill rate of 90 %, general
rule of thumb is to select a prime near 1.2 * maximum_qps.

*Default:* 393241

.. _server_rate-limit-slip:

rate-limit-slip
---------------

As attacks using DNS/UDP are usually based on a forged source address,
an attacker could deny services to the victim's netblock if all
responses would be completely blocked. The idea behind SLIP mechanism
is to send each N\ :sup:`th` response as truncated, thus allowing client to
reconnect via TCP for at least some degree of service. It is worth
noting, that some responses can't be truncated (e.g. SERVFAIL).

- Setting the value to **0** will cause that all rate-limited responses will
  be dropped. The outbound bandwidth and packet rate will be strictly capped
  by the :ref:`server_rate-limit` option. All legitimate requestors affected
  by the limit will face denial of service and will observe excessive timeouts.
  Therefore this setting is not recommended.

- Setting the value to **1** will cause that all rate-limited responses will
  be sent as truncated. The amplification factor of the attack will be reduced,
  but the outbound data bandwidth won't be lower than the incoming bandwidth.
  Also the outbound packet rate will be the same as without RRL.

- Setting the value to **2** will cause that half of the rate-limited responses
  will be dropped, the other half will be sent as truncated. With this
  configuration, both outbound bandwidth and packet rate will be lower than the
  inbound. On the other hand, the dropped responses enlarge the time window
  for possible cache poisoning attack on the resolver.

- Setting the value to anything **larger than 2** will keep on decreasing
  the outgoing rate-limited bandwidth, packet rate, and chances to notify
  legitimate requestors to reconnect using TCP. These attributes are inversely
  proportional to the configured value. Setting the value high is not advisable.

*Default:* 1

.. _server_rate-limit-whitelist:

- ``%c[``\ *N*\ ``]`` or ``%c[``\ *N*\ ``-``\ *M*\ ``]`` – means the *N*\ th
  character or a sequence of characters beginning from the *N*\ th and ending
  with the *M*\ th character of the textual zone name (see ``%s``). The
  indexes are counted from 0 from the left. All dots (including the terminal
  one) are considered. If the character is not available, the formatter has no effect.
- ``%l[``\ *N*\ ``]`` – means the *N*\ th label of the textual zone name
  (see ``%s``). The index is counted from 0 from the right (0 ~ TLD).
  If the label is not available, the formatter has no effect.
- ``%s`` – means the current zone name in the textual representation (beware
  of special characters which are escaped or encoded in the \\DDD form where
  DDD is corresponding decimal ASCII code). The zone name doesn't include the
  terminating dot (the result for the root zone is the empty string!).
- ``%%`` – means the ``%`` character

*Default:* :ref:`storage<zone_storage>`/``%s``\ .zone

.. _zone_journal:

or disallow zone transfers, updates or incoming notifies.

*Default:* not set

.. _zone_semantic-checks:

semantic-checks
---------------

If enabled, extra zone file semantic checks are turned on.

Several checks are enabled by default and cannot be turned off. An error in
mandatory checks causes zone not to be loaded. An error in extra checks is
logged only.

Mandatory checks:

- An extra record together with CNAME record (except for RRSIG and DS)
- SOA record missing in the zone (RFC 1034)
- DNAME records having records under it (DNAME children) (RFC 2672)

Extra checks:

- Missing NS record at the zone apex
- Missing glue A or AAAA records
- Broken or non-cyclic NSEC(3) chain
- Wrong NSEC(3) type bitmap
- Multiple NSEC records at the same node
- Missing NSEC records at authoritative nodes
- NSEC3 insecure delegation that is not part of Opt-out span
- Wrong original TTL value in NSEC3 records
- Wrong RDATA TTL value in RRSIG record
- Signer name in RRSIG RR not the same as in DNSKEY

- Wrong key flags or wrong key in RRSIG record (not the same as ZSK)

*Default:* off

.. _zone_disable-any:

disable-any
-----------

If enabled, all authoritative ANY queries sent over UDP will be answered
with an empty response and with the TC bit set. Use this option to minimize
the risk of DNS reflection attack.

*Default:* off

.. _zone_zonefile-sync:

zonefile-sync
-------------

The time after which the current zone in memory will be synced with a zone file
on the disk (see :ref:`file<zone_file>`). The server will serve the latest
zone even after a restart using zone journal, but the zone file on the disk will
only be synced after ``zonefile-sync`` time has expired (or after manual zone
flush). This is applicable when the zone is updated via IXFR, DDNS or automatic
DNSSEC signing. In order to disable automatic zonefile synchronization, -1 value
can be used (manual zone flush is still possible).

.. NOTE::
   If you are serving large zones with frequent updates where
   the immediate sync with a zone file is not desirable, increase the value.

*Default:* 0 (immediate)

.. _zone_ixfr-from-differences:

ixfr-from-differences
---------------------

If enabled, the server creates zone differences from changes you made to the
zone file upon server reload. This option is relevant only if the server
is a master server for the zone.

.. NOTE::
   This option has no effect with enabled
   :ref:`dnssec-signing<zone_dnssec-signing>`.

*Default:* off

.. _zone_max_journal_size:

max-journal-size
----------------

Maximum size of the zone journal file.

*Default:* 2^64

.. _zone_max_zone_size:

max-zone-size
----------------

Maximum size of the zone. The size is measured as size of the zone records
in wire format without compression. The limit is enforced for incoming zone
transfers and dynamic updates.

For incremental transfers (IXFR), the effective limit for the total size of
the records in the transfer is twice the configured value. However the final
size of the zone must satisfy the configured value.

*Default:* 2^64

.. _zone_dnssec-signing:

dnssec-signing
--------------

If enabled, automatic DNSSEC signing for the zone is turned on.

.. NOTE::
   Cannot be enabled on a slave zone.

*Default:* off

dnssec-policy
-------------

A :ref:`reference<policy_id>` to DNSSEC signing policy. A special *default*
value can be used for the default policy settings.

*Required*

.. _zone_kasp-db:

kasp-db
-------

A KASP database path. Non absolute path is relative to
:ref:`storage<zone_storage>`.

*Default:* :ref:`storage<zone_storage>`/keys

.. _zone_request_edns_option:

request-edns-option
-------------------

An arbitrary EDNS0 option which is included into a server request (AXFR, IXFR,
SOA, or NOTIFY). The value is in the option_code:option_data format.

*Default:* not set

.. _zone_serial-policy:

serial-policy
-------------

Specifies how the zone serial is updated after a dynamic update or
automatic DNSSEC signing. If the serial is changed by the dynamic update,
no change is made.

Possible values:

- ``increment`` – The serial is incremented according to serial number arithmetic
- ``unixtime`` – The serial is set to the current unix time

.. NOTE::
   If your serial was in other than unix time format, be careful
   with the transition to unix time.  It may happen that the new serial will
   be \'lower\' than the old one. If this is the case, the transition should be
   done by hand (see RFC 1982).

*Default:* increment

.. _zone_module:

module
------

An ordered list of references to query modules in the form of *module_name* or
*module_name/module_id*. These modules apply only to the current zone queries.

*Default:* not set

.. _Logging section:

Logging section
===============

Server can be configured to log to the standard output, standard error
output, syslog (or systemd journal if systemd is enabled) or into an arbitrary
file.

There are 6 logging severity levels:

- ``critical`` – Non-recoverable error resulting in server shutdown

- ``error`` – Recoverable error, action should be taken

- ``warning`` – Warning that might require user action

- ``notice`` – Server notice or hint

- ``info`` – Informational message

- ``debug`` – Debug messages (must be turned on at compile time)

In the case of missing log section, ``warning`` or more serious messages
will be logged to both standard error output and syslog. The ``info`` and
``notice`` messages will be logged to standard output.
