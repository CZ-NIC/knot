What is Knot DNS
================

Knot DNS is a high-performance open-source DNS server. It
implements only the authoritative domain name service. Knot DNS
is best suited for use on TLD domains but it can reliably serve
any other zones as well.

Knot DNS benefits from its multi-threaded and mostly lock-free
implementation which allows it to scale well on SMP systems and
operate non-stop even when adding or removing zones.
