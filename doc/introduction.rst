What is Knot DNS
================

Knot DNS is a high-performance open-source DNS server. It
implements only the authoritative domain name service. Knot DNS
can reliably serve TLD domains as well as any other zones.

Knot DNS benefits from its multi-threaded and mostly lock-free
implementation which allows it to scale well on SMP systems and
operate non-stop even when adding or removing zones.
