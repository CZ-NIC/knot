Description: DNS clients provided with Knot DNS (kdig, knsupdate)
 Knot DNS is a fast, authoritative only, high performance, feature
 full and open source name server.
 .
 Knot DNS is developed by CZ.NIC Labs, the R&D department of .CZ
 registry and hence is well suited to run anything from the root
 zone, the top-level domain, to many smaller standard domain names.
 .
 This package delivers various DNS client programs from Knot DNS.
 .
  - kdig - query a DNS server in various ways
  - knsupdate - perform dynamic updates (See RFC2136)
  - kxdpgun - send a DNS query stream over UDP to a DNS server
 .
 Those clients were designed to be almost 1:1 compatible with BIND dnsutils,
 but they provide some enhancements, which are documented.
 .
 WARNING: knslookup is not provided as it is considered obsolete.
